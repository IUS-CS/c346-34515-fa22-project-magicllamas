## Tools
There are basic tools to get familiar with:

* [A programming platform that supports Java such as IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)
* [Maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html)
* [Discord Wrappers/Libraries such as Discord4J](https://discord4j.com/)
## Usage
The Discord Bot is a useful assitant on a Discord server. It is really cool that discord bots can be configured because *not all Discord servers are made equal.* Having a personalized Discord bot can make group chats, group meetings, and more that much more easier.
