# Discord Bot Proposal
## by Authors

The purpose of this document is to give an outline of how the discord bot semester project is outlined. The authors decided to work on a discord bot. This document might be edited or reviewed thorughout the semester.

### Introduction

Our first couple of meetings consisted of brainstorming ideas and working together on figuring out the basics. We knew we wanted to configure a robot but we were not sure about where the virtual robot platform was going to be. So we finally winded up on an idea to build a Discord Bot. This a a virtual robot that can have many functionalities. Some purposes can include basic greetings to assistant work. In other words, functionalities can be endless. We will spend this week figuring out what functionalities we would like to include. 
### Goals

The discord robot should be able to perform several functionalities. Some of the common functionalities we would like to include are:
* Recognize greetings and respond
* Give a brief summary of its functionalities when it is asked to do so.
* Pull up links or references.
* welcome members
* play games
* moderate content
* and more

### Tools
Java is the language that everyone on the team is happy to work with. Coding this bot and finally putting it online is going to require these tools:
* Java Maven
*  Discord API libraries
* OAuth2
* Github 
* Discrod4J
* IntelliJ IDEA

### Deliverables
* Github project repository
* Discord bot on Discord

### Conclusion

In summary, the discord bot that the authors would like to create will be in java and then launched on Discord. It will contain basic functionalities and more.
